## Project #1 - Automate Timesheet tracking with GPS and image capture

To build a timesheet tracking system (attendance tracking) where users will use mobile Interface, reports will be viewed on web interface.
Employees will login into the app with their employee Id and Password, immediately after login user image will be captured. System sends the image and their GPS location to the server.
As long as the user stays logged into the system via a mobile device, the GPS location will continue to be automatically updated and forwarded to the server at regular interval, let say every 5 mins. When the user logs out, their image and GPS location are again sent to the server.

Admin can view the reports/details on the web interface. This application allows Admin to keep track of employee attendance and can be integrated in payroll for calculating their working days and payroll. This application enables HR/Admin to keep an accurate record of working days of individual employees and tweak their payroll accordingly.
